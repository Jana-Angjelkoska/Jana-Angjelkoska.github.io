            Music has the remarkable ability to touch the depths of our souls, resonating with our emotions and captivating our senses. Within the vast landscape of musical genres, few hold the power to evoke a sense of raw passion, individualism, and intensity quite like metal and goth music, genres that have a great impact on me.        </div>
        <div class="hidden">
            <div class="container-title">Chess</div>Chess has always been a vital part of my life. Actually, there was
            a time where I thought about being a professional chess player. If you wonder where I got that idea, the simple
            reason of many trophies and medals I have of chess might make sense. I've been a female junior champion 6 times,
            throughout the years 2012-2020.

            of reading since a very young age. In the past, I enjoyed reading sci-fi and fantasy, but
            today I read books related to the fields that interest me, like technology and science.

            at times, myself as well. In recent days, I try using AI to understand and research such things.

                Group projects are something I look forward to during my studies ad FSCE. Here is one idea I had:
                a health app to track and measure health performances in one day.
                The app could be connected to a server in a hospital where patients could share information. This could be helpful for elders, athletes and people who care about their health in general.

            <div class="projects-explanation">
                When I was first introduced to the programming languages C and C++, I got the idea to develop
                a very simple game. At first, I created tic-tac-toe in both languages, as an exercise, sucesfully.
                The other idea was developing a game like Hangman, which would count the wring guesses and show the remaining
                attempts. This game could be played with 3-5 people.
